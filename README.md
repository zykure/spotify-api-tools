# Spotify API tools

These are some tools / scripts that utilize the Spotify API. They are written in Python.

To use them, you first need to register an API client at: https://developer.spotify.com/

Then, copy the file `config.py.template` to `config.py` and update it with your client credentials. These credentials should be kept private.

## Dependencies:

* SpotiPy - https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/

```
pip install spotipy
```
